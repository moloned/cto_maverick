# 17 Jan 2020

I started this today based on Jeremy Howard's template https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/

The blog is now accessible on https://moloned.github.io/cto_maverick/

The only issue not codered in Jeremy's blog entry was that you need to set the Github Pages section of the settings menu for your blog repo to Master otherwise the blog isn't accessible and you get a 404 error
